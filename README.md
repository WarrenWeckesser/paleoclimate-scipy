# paleoclimate-scipy

This package contains the data, algorithms and analysis scripts that support
the SciPy chapter in the [PyData Cookbook](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-cookbook).
That chapter aims to illustrate advanced usage of SciPy, and is built around
reproducing a famous paper on paleo-climate reconstructions:

*M.E. Mann et al., "Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global
surface temperature variations over the past two millennia", PNAS 2008 105
(36) 13252-13257, doi:10.1073/pnas.0805721105.*
